# Bash Portfolio ðŸ§™

## Description
This bash script was written as a project during my time working as an intern at **365 Retail Markets**.
It takes you on a journey in the theme of a traveler entering a wizardâ€™s tavern, where youâ€™ll learn about me, discover fun interactions, and even connect to my socials! 

The goal: share my story, showcase my skills, and provide a little fun along the way. :D
